    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A fried egg is an easy, but tasty dish to make. You can eat it by itself or put it on another dish to compliment it. In Lao cuisine, we have a dish called Pad Kapow aka Minced Pork with Holy Basil. Topped with a fried egg is optional. The crispiness of the eggwhite sides and creaminess of the yolk are my favorite parts of the fried egg. Another way I like to eat a fried egg is to put it on top of a bed of white rice and squirt a few drops of mushroom soy sauce. Mix it all together and you have a mouthful of wonderful flavors!</p>
