    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Steak is one of my favorite meats to cook. It is very versatile and can be cooked in various ways. My favorite method of cooking a steak is using the reverse sear method. Reverse searing is simply cooking the steak from the inside first to reach a target temperature to your liking then searing the outside og the steak on high heat to create a crust. Thus, making a perfectly cooked steak. Before I proceed to cook a steak, I must first make certain preparations. I personally like to dry brine my steak before cooking. I sprinkle a generous amount of kosher salt to the steak on all sides and leave it in the refridgerator uncovered for at least a day. Two days max. What this does is it soaks up moisture from the steak but also retains the flavor at the same time. You will have a much nicer sear this way.</p>
