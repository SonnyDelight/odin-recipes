    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Instant ramen was one of my favorite meals to make as a kid. I would come home from school and make myself a pot. It was one of the first meals I learned to make on the stove. It is very easy to make, has a ton a flavor, and fills you up. My favorite instant ramen brand is Mama. I usually add more condiments to my bowl of ramen instead of just using the sauce packets that it comes with. I like to add sriracha, hoison sauce, fish sauce, and lime juice. Doing this takes the flavor to a whole other level. </p>
